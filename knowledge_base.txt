Shipment Management Module – In-Depth Documentation
Purpose:
This module is designed to create, edit, manage, and track export units (vehicles or containers) through the full lifecycle of a shipment. It supports operational planning, customs compliance (e.g., AES), carrier integration (e.g., Grimaldi), document generation (e.g., B/L), and internal logistics coordination (e.g., transport from auction to port).

1. Unit Tab – Core Data Entry
Overview
The Unit tab is the foundational screen for creating a shipment. It captures everything from customer data to shipping line, physical dimensions, customs values, and pricing. This data flows downstream into B/Ls, AES filings, invoices, and terminal integration.

Sections and Fields
Parties Section
Agent: Logistics provider managing the shipment. Often auto-filled.

Shipper: Entity shipping the cargo. Can match Agent.

Exporter: The official exporter for AES purposes.

Consignee: Recipient at the destination. Required.

Notify: Party to be notified upon arrival.

Intermediate Consignee: Optional. Used when there's a broker or intermediary.

All fields support inline selection or creation. Same-as shortcuts help replicate data quickly.

Shipping Section
Issued On: Date the shipment record was created or formalized.

Line: Shipping line used (e.g., Grimaldi, MSC).

POL: Port of Loading – origin point of the international leg.

Terminal: Terminal within the POL. Affects carrier integration.

POD: Port of Discharge – destination port.

Intermediate POD: Optional stop or transshipment port.

2. Related Units Tab
Used to associate additional vehicles or cargo with the master unit. Each related unit is treated as an individual item under the primary container or B/L.

Add Related Vehicle Workflow:
Relation: Type of linkage (STC, Associated, etc.).

VIN/Serial: Unique identifier for each related unit.

Make/Model: Required. Must be manually entered.

HS Code: Required.

Registration Year, Qty, Value, Weight: Optional but recommended.

Registration No, Origin, Condition: For customs and documentation.

Exclude from B/L: When checked, this related unit will not appear on B/L documents.

Custom documents can be uploaded for each related unit via the Files tab (lower section).

3. Bill of Lading (B/L) Tab
Overrides and controls data used in document generation.

Key Fields:
Code / Reference: Internal control IDs.

Make/Model: Manual override. If entered, this replaces system values on the B/L.

Manual checkbox: Prevents VIN decoder or integrations from overriding custom description.

Length / Width / Height / CBM / Weight: Used in booking summary.

Lock CBM: Prevents system recalculation of CBM.

Print Status: Controls how the B/L is processed with the carrier:

Seaway Bill

Telex Release

Print at Destination

Originals at Origin

Remark: Optional text that appears on B/L.

4. Clearance / Customs / Admin Tab
Tracks both export and import clearance requirements. Heavily tied to AES and CTN functionality.

Customs Section:
Customs Template: Required for U.S. exports. Prefills AES-required fields.

GUOT/UCR: Customs references (rarely used).

CTN: Required for West African countries like Benin. Needed before manifest is sent.

Inspection No / Invoice: Document references.

Export Customs:
Export Clearance: Checkbox for cleared cargo.

ITN: Mandatory for U.S. AES. Format: X202XXXXXXX.

Status / Cleared On / Clearing Agent: Tracks export process.

Import Customs:
Import Customs NB / T1 / Cleared On / Status: Destination-side tracking.

Vehicle Details:
Body Type / Fuel Type / Engine Capacity / Cylinder Count

Exterior/Interior Color: System values or custom text.

5. Files Tab
Used to attach shipment-related documentation.

Document Types:
Unit Photo

Commercial Invoice

Registration Document

Other

Documents can be previewed, deleted, or downloaded. The lower half of the tab is dedicated to documents attached to related units.

Captures pre-carriage logistics, like transporting from auction yard to POL.

Fields:
Departure / Arrival: Required locations.

Self-Shipped: If checked, customer is handling inland transport.

Append Address: Optional pickup/delivery site.

Order: Useful for multi-leg routes.

Multiple rows can be added to support complex inland logistics before port delivery.

8. Integration Log Tab
Displays API/EDI activity related to this shipment.

Types of Entries:
SendBooking: Booking data sent to carrier.

GetBooking: Booking confirmation or response from carrier.

Each row shows:

Timestamp

Success/Error status

Type of message

This is essential for troubleshooting missing data or sync issues.

9. Issues Tab
Appears only for integrated units when there are problems in communication or policy violations.

Examples:
Declared Length cannot be changed after loading

Booking updates will no longer be sent to carrier

These are typically triggered by carrier rules via EDI. Users must acknowledge the issues by checking a box before saving.

Blocking a Shipment
To block a shipment:

Use the Block field in the Unit tab.

This may disable:

Carrier booking

Terminal release

Documentation generation

Add a note explaining the block in the Terms/Notes tab.

Unblock by clearing the field and saving again.

VIN Decoding
VIN decoding is supported through a small clickable square next to the Serial/VIN input field.

Once a 17-character VIN is entered, the square activates.

Clicking it will decode the VIN and auto-fill Make, Model, and Year (and possibly engine/fuel).

Manual changes can be made in the B/L tab without overwriting.

Overriding Make/Model for Documents
Use the Make/Model field in the B/L tab to override what appears on documents.

Check the Manual box to prevent auto-replacement.

This allows use of detailed descriptors like “Toyota Corolla LE Hybrid 1.8L.”

Adding Units Inside a Main Unit
To add related units:

Use the Related Units tab.

Click Add Related Vehicle.

Fill in all required info.

Related units are logically tied to the parent and can appear on documents, or be excluded if needed.
